This is designed to generate ship fittings for the game Eve Online based off records of destroyed ships (killmails).

The two csvs contain static data about modules and ships in Eve, and the json file is a sample batch of killmails.

ToDo:

Write generative network and test, including a "itemID" to English function 

In Progress
(4/4) Based on advice recieved from Daniel Canaday, rewrite loss function to permit any remaining module on ship equipment.
